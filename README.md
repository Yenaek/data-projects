# Data Projects

A repository for all my data-related projects (mainly data analysis)


## Description of projects

### 2019 Stack Overflow Developer Survey
Data analysis of the 2019 Stack Overflow Developer survey results in three different softwares:
* Microsoft Excel: data transformation and creation of two dashboards
* Microsoft Power BI: usage of the data transformed in Excel to recreate the same dashboards
* Jupyter Notebook (Python): complete analysis from scratch with NumPy, pandas and Plotly

The source dataset can downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QOmVDpd8hcVYqqUXDXf68UMDWQZP0wQV/view) (the file is too large to include in the repository).

You can view the Excel version of the analysis [here](https://ipppt-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/2161161_iscap_ipp_pt/EZyjLWRSLGlLrl4mob110y4BwXPpXtswPM8WR3chfE-LWA?e=25Y4ia).

You can find the results of Power BI version of the analysis as a PDF in [this folder](https://github.com/Ze1598/data-projects/tree/master/SO2019DevSurvey/results) of the repository or as a downloadable .pbix file in [this folder](https://github.com/Ze1598/data-projects/tree/master/SO2019DevSurvey/power%20bi).

You can view the Python version of the analysis in an HTML version of the resulting Jupyter Notebook [here](https://so2019devsurvey.ze1598.repl.co/).
