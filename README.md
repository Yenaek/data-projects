# Data Projects

A repository for all my data-related projects.


## Description of projects

### 2019 Stack Overflow Developer Survey
Data analysis of the 2019 Stack Overflow Developer survey results in three different softwares:
* Microsoft Excel: data transformation and creation of two dashboards
* Microsoft Power BI: usage of the data transformed in Excel to recreate the same dashboards
* Jupyter Notebook (Python): complete analysis from scratch with NumPy, pandas and Plotly
* R Notebook: same analysis made in Python, but replicated with R code

The source dataset can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QOmVDpd8hcVYqqUXDXf68UMDWQZP0wQV/view) (the file is too large to include in the repository).

You can view the Excel version of the analysis [here](https://ipppt-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/2161161_iscap_ipp_pt/EZyjLWRSLGlLrl4mob110y4BwXPpXtswPM8WR3chfE-LWA?e=25Y4ia).

You can find the results of Power BI version of the analysis as a PDF in [this folder](https://github.com/Ze1598/data-projects/tree/master/SO2019DevSurvey/results) of the repository or as a downloadable .pbix file in [this folder](https://github.com/Ze1598/data-projects/tree/master/SO2019DevSurvey/power%20bi).

You can view the Python version of the analysis in an HTML version of the resulting Jupyter Notebook [here](https://so2019devsurvey.ze1598.repl.co/).

The R notebook is available [here](https://github.com/Ze1598/data-projects/blob/master/SO2019DevSurvey/results/R_data_analysis.html) too.


### Demos
Smaller demos created for specific purposes, such as how to perform a certain operation in Python, data analyses in Power BI, ..., including the resulting files of tutorials I've completed. The link to the original datasets can always be found in the respective "source.txt" file.
Some examples of the demos available so far:

* [Creation of an anime dataset by scraping LiveChart.me with Power BI](https://github.com/Ze1598/data-projects/tree/master/demos/livechart%20data%20scrape%20%5Bpower%20bi%5D)
* [Data Analysis of an Olympics dataset from Kaggle](https://github.com/Ze1598/data-projects/tree/master/demos/olympics%20%5Bpower%20bi%5D)
* [How to unpivot delimited data with Python and pandas](https://github.com/Ze1598/data-projects/tree/master/demos/unpivot%20delimited%20data%20%5Bpandas%5D)


### Spotify API
Proofs of concept about extracting data from the Spotify API using the [Spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.11.2/) wrapper.

* [playlist_artists](https://github.com/Ze1598/data-projects/tree/master/spotify/playlists_artists): Extract information about the artists featured in a playlist and plot their frequencies in a column chart
