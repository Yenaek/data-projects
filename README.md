# Data Projects

A repository for all my data-related projects (mainly data analysis)


## Description of projects

### 2019 Stack Overflow Developer Survey
Data analysis of the 2019 Stack Overflow Developer survey results in three different softwares:
* Microsoft Excel: data transformation and creation of two dashboards
* Microsoft Power BI: usage of the data transformed in Excel to recreate the same dashboards
* Jupyter Notebook (Python): complete analysis from scratch with NumPy, pandas and Plotly

The source dataset can downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QOmVDpd8hcVYqqUXDXf68UMDWQZP0wQV/view) (the file is too large to include in the repository).
